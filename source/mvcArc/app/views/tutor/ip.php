            <p style="padding: 0px 5%;margin-top: -10px;text-align: left;width: 90%">Programming is the process of
                creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using
                a variety of computer "languages," such as SQL, Java,<br>
                Python, and C++. Created by Pamela Fox.</p>
            <p style="padding: 0px 5%;margin-top: -10px;text-align: left;width: 90%">Programs are commonly referred to
                as software. Software is essential to a computer because
                it controls everything the computer does. All of the software that we use to make our computers useful
                is created by individuals working as programmers or software developers. A
                programmer, or software developer, is a person with the training and skills necessary to
                design, create, and test computer programs. Computer programming is an exciting and
                rewarding career. Today, you will find programmersâ€™ work used in business, medicine, government, law
                enforcement, agriculture, academics, entertainment, and many other fields.</p>
